Simple CLI tool in rust that lets you chat to the Mistral LLM. Shout out to all my vimmers out there too lazy to switch to the browser

You need to set the 'MISTRAL_API_KEY' environment variable to use it, obviously

Type quit to save your conversation history and exit the program. You can then resume the conversation at a later point. The log is stored at $HOME/.mistral_cli_chat_history. This will be used to jog the LLM's memory.
